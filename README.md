# alda-repl-clj

A Clojure implementation of an [Alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda) **R**ead-**E**val-**P**lay **L**oop.

> NOTE: We eventually want to [rewrite the Alda REPL as part of the Java client](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/issues/154).

## Development

### Prerequisites

Development on the Alda REPL requires that you have the [Boot](http://boot-clj.com) build tool installed. This allows you to run the Alda REPL locally for development.

### `boot dev` task

You can use the `boot dev` task to run an Alda REPL with any local changes.
